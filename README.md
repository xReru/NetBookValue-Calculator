# NetBookValue-Calculator
This project is all about computing Net Book Value using java class. 
The historical value of a company's assets, or how the assets are documented by the accountant, is referred to as net book value (NBV). NBV is computed by subtracting the asset's depreciation, depletion, or amortization from the asset's original cost, which is the price paid to acquire the asset.
This is my program to calculate the Net book Value.
